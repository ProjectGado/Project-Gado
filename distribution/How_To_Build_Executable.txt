In order to build an executable version of the source code, you need to execute the correct
build script for your platform.

Windows:

    Vista/7 (32/64-bit):
    
        Use the "BuildWindows(Vista_7)Exe.bat" batch file. If you are building on a 64bit version
        of Windows, then the resulting exe will be 64 bit.
        
        Likewise, if you are building on a 32bit version of Windows, the resulting exe will be
        32 bit.
        
    XP (32-bit):
    
        Use the "BuildWindows(XP)Exe.bat" batch file. This will result in a 32-bit executable that
        is capable of being run on Windows XP.
